Website has become multi-faceted:
- svelte for the cart. Reasons were 3-fold
---- Needed for cart operations to not require a server reload
---- Something lightweight
---- To learn svelte!
- NodeJS(GraphQL) for the data server
- PHP for the pages

Product can be queried and added to the cart from the front-end with proper 'id'
Logic resides in svelte

Decided to add products on the landing page
All or Just a few?!? TBD

Logic for adding products to cart will reside in svelte
