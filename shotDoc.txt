Front | includes the web files aswell as svelte cart
---- svelte | includes the cart
------ components
-------- cartDrawer.svelte | a container for the cart
-------- cartContent.svelte | main logic for cart operations
-------- cartProductCard.svelte | a template for a product
---- *.php | the main web files

DataServer | a NodeJS Graphql server. Session-managed with express-session-mysql
---- server.js
---- schema.js | Graphql schema
---- databaseManajer.js | includes boilerplate code for intereacting with mysql

TODO:
---- Set-up a pre-deployment tool to turn *.php that can be made static into html
---- Think around making as much page to be as static as possible
---- So far I think all pages can be made to be static as all pages *load* the same content for every visit!
---- If so look into setting up a JAM stack. You've got the J and A part set-up.

Website has become multi-faceted:
- svelte for the cart. Reasons were 3-fold
---- Needed for cart operations to not require a server reload
---- Something lightweight
---- To learn svelte!
- NodeJS(GraphQL) for the data server
- PHP for the pages

Product can be queried and added to the cart from the front-end with proper 'id'
Logic resides in svelte

Decided to add products on the landing page
All or Just a few?!? TBD

Logic for adding products to cart will reside in svelte

Friday 21/01/2020
Product Mockup was completed yesterday as well as an image viewer to view flyers
Winston logger added to DataServer
    npm i winston
Products List:
    A products list based on a flex design will be generated using php
    php fetches data from the Graphql API and populates a product.html template with the data
    PHP then construts an HTML of the product list. The flex-design resides in the main css file(Make own file?)
    The use of a single data server is paying off already. ~few lines of php just to fetch the data
    Graphql is amazing.
Issues:
    PHP fails to open connection using SSL. Says certificate validation fails but that might be
    because the certificate is self signed on dev server. To test on live server
        Solved by not checking certificate validity when environement is set to "development" in env.ini!!!!
        Huge security hole so make sure env is set properly.

Loading of products on the front page is automated (populated server-side)
svelte cart currently adds an event listener on the "Add to cart" btn of the products
    the button is populated,by php server side, with the product id on its 'data-id' attr.

Good Productive day/week.


Friday 28/01/2022 - Week resume (Not that productive)
Cookies have been enabled
cart is saved on DataServer using Cookies. Front side now asks DataServer to add product id to cart
work on adding loaders on product/cartproducts has been started
    loaders on products has bee completed
cartContent.svelte now deals strictly with logic that happens in the physical shopping cart
everthing else (Like adding a new product to cart) has been moved to cartDrawer.svelte

Monday 31/01/2022
cartDrawer.svelte contains logic that depends on whic pages contains products that are to be added to cart
    So that we don't need to look for cartproducts on EVERY page.

After converstation with Joseph, it was decided that sessions products should have the same old look
---- Not a flyer but still a bullet image with a description of the session
---- Still with a link to the page that gives more information
---- Be able to register as well as pay
-------- Means input informationabout the athelte as well as their Parent/Guardian information

Thursday 24/03/2022
---- Starting work on registering
---- Idea is to add a register form on each session page.
---- Then when At least one Athelte and Guardian Info has been added, allow to add to cart and save on server.
---- Then use the same payment flow
---- Add "Template" to each file name that is a template(Needs some data to be added to it to be usefull.)
---- Templating done using the basic {{key}} technique.
---- (Partly&Skeleton only)Session Form added. Only contains athlete form.

Monday 21/06/2022
---- Can now add session to cart
---- Working n repopulating page with session information that has been added to cart
-------- This is done in case user wnats to edit session infomration(Add/remove athlete for e.g.)
