Website has become multi-faceted:
- svelte for the cart. Reasons were 3-fold
---- Needed for cart operations to not require a server reload
---- Something lightweight
---- To learn svelte!
- NodeJS(GraphQL) for the data server
- PHP for the pages

Product can be queried and added to the cart from the front-end with proper 'id'
Logic resides in svelte

Decided to add products on the landing page
All or Just a few?!? TBD

Logic for adding products to cart will reside in svelte

Friday 21/01/2020
Product Mockup was completed yesterday as well as an image viewer to view flyers
Winston logger added to DataServer
    npm i winston
Products List:
    A products list based on a flex design will be generated using php
    php fetches data from the Graphql API and populates a product.html template with the data
    PHP then construts an HTML of the product list. The flex-design resides in the main css file(Make own file?)
    The use of a single data server is paying off already. ~few lines of php just to fetch the data
    Graphql is amazing.
Issues:
    PHP fails to open connection using SSL. Says certificate validation fails but that might be
    because the certificate is self signed on dev server. To test on live server
        Solved by not checking certificate validity when environement is set to "development" in env.ini!!!!
        Huge security hole so make sure env is set properly.

Loading of products on the front page is automated (populated server-side)
svelte cart currently adds an event listener on the "Add to cart" btn of the products
    the button is populated,by php server side, with the product id on its 'data-id' attr.

Good Productive day/week.


Friday 28/01/2022 - Week resume (Not that productive)
Cookies have been enabled
cart is saved on DataServer using Cookies. Front side now asks DataServer to add product id to cart
work on adding loaders on product/cartproducts has been started
    loaders on products has bee completed
cartContent.svelte now deals strictly with logic that happens in the physical shopping cart
everthing else (Like adding a new product to cart) has been moved to cartDrawer.svelte
